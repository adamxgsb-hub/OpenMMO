 * First-launch GPU probe. Runs a compute workload on a throwaway WebGPU
 * device and reports a throughput score, so the initial graphics preset can

 *
 * Compute rather than a render pass: `queue.onSubmittedWorkDone()` gives a
 * real GPU completion signal, so the timing never has to fight vsync
 * clamping or compositor latency the way rAF-based fill-rate probes do.
 *
 * Must run before the renderer exists — `antialias` is fixed at
 * `new WebGPURenderer()` and can't be changed without a reload.
 *
 * Reference measurements, both Chrome 150:
 *   RTX 4090 (nvidia/lovelace, Windows)      ~1730, overhead ~3.0ms, ±8%
 *   M3 10-core (apple/metal-3, MacBook Air 15) ~92, overhead ~0.6ms, ±1.5%
 * The ~19x gap tracks their fp32 throughput ratio, so the probe is measuring
 * something real. Probe cost runs 110-300ms.

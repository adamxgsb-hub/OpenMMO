/**
 * dungeon-geometry.ts — procedural mesh building for dungeon floors.
 *
 * Follows the housing pattern: collect GeoEntry quads/boxes per texture
 * index, merge into one mesh per texture (addMergedMeshes), reuse the
 * shared housing materials so no new WebGPU pipelines are compiled.
 *
 * Conventions (must mirror shared/src/dungeon):
 * - Group origin sits at (originX, floorY(depth), originZ); all geometry
 *   is local. Local y=0 is this floor's walking surface.
 * - No ceiling on underground floors: the isometric camera looks down ~35°,
 *   any current-floor ceiling would fully occlude the player. The void reads
 *   as cave dark. (The surface entrance is the one exception — it carries a
 *   gravel roof, always shown at depth 0; the player only descends the stairs,
 *   never stands inside, so it never needs to hide.)
 * - Walls on all four sides are emitted as per-run meshes in their own
 *   sub-group; the dungeon layer fades any run to a
 *   ghost while it occludes the player from the iso camera. Camera-facing
 *   south/west runs fade often; the far north/east runs only when the layout
 *   puts them between the camera and the player. Floor slab, chest and the
 *   down-shaft stairs stay merged into the shared opaque mesh.
 * - Stair shafts render both directions per floor: the up shaft you
 *   arrived by (rising to +floorHeight) and the down shaft (descending
 *   to -floorHeight). Adjacent floors build the identical world-space
 *   boxes for the shared shaft, so switching the rendered floor at the
 *   shaft midpoint is seamless.
 *
 * This module is the public entry point: it re-exports the builders and types
 * from the sibling `dungeon-geo-*.ts` modules (split by concern) and owns the
 * `disposeDungeonGroup` lifecycle helper. Importers keep using this path.

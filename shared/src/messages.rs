//! WebSocket protocol envelopes between client and server. `ClientMessage`
//! is everything a client can ask for (move, attack, place house, equip
//! item …); `ServerMessage` is everything the server pushes back (world
//! snapshots, combat results, inventory deltas, kicks). Both serialize
//! via MessagePack — convenience helpers at the bottom of the file
//! centralise the `rmp_serde::to_vec` / `from_slice` calls so callers
//! don't have to know the wire format.

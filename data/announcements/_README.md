# How to write announcements

Add one `.md` file per announcement to this directory and it shows up on the
login screen. Entries are sorted newest-first by date, and the newest 50 are shown.

## File format

Name files like `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. The leading date is used for sorting.

Write the English body here.
Line breaks are preserved as-is.
```

- `title`: Default-language (Korean) title. If omitted, the first body line (or
  the first `# heading`) is used.
- `title_en`: English title. Add other languages as `title_<code>` (e.g. `title_ja`).
- `date`: If omitted, the `YYYY-MM-DD` prefix of the filename is used. An entry
  with no resolvable date is left out.
- `category`: Optional. Shown as a tag on the login screen (e.g. update, plan, event).
- Body: Text before the first `[xx]` marker is the default language (Korean). A
  line like `[en]` starts that language's body.

Put multiple languages in one file and users can switch with the language buttons
on the login screen. Write only one language (no `[xx]` markers) to show just that
one. Files whose name starts with `_` (including this README) are excluded from the list.

# Fishing

Cast a rod at water, wait for the bite, hook in time, land the fish. The first
gathering profession, and the first consumer of the trained-skill system
(`shared/src/skills.rs`). Server-authoritative end to end: every timer, roll
and outcome lives in `server/src/game_state/fishing.rs`; clients render
broadcasts and answer with `FishingRespond`.

## The loop

```
FishingCast ─► Casting (1 s) ─► Waiting (4–12 s, skill-shortened)
                                    │ bite rolls the fish (species/size/trophy)
                                    ▼
                              Bite (2.5 s + 0.5 s latency grace)
                              │ Hook in time      │ too late / never
                              ▼                   ▼
                           Caught              Escaped
```

**Getting a rod:** buy a Fishing Rod from a general merchant (Rica stocks it
for 3 silver — a starter tool between a torch and a potion) and equip it in
the main hand.
Rods are excluded from dungeon treasure chests — they are bought tools, not
endgame combat loot (`server/src/item_defs.rs::equipment_ids_with_min_price`).

- **Cast** (`FishingCast { position }`): needs a fishing rod in the main hand
  (`category == "fishing_rod"`), the overworld floor, a target within 8 m, and
  **water**. Water is `waterSurfaceY − terrainBed > 0.1 m` at the target,
  sampled server-side from the baked **unified water field** (WFD1, sea +
  rivers) via `terrain::WaterSampler` alongside the terrain `HeightSampler`.
  This is true over the **ocean** (surface at sea level, bed below) AND over
  **rivers** (the carved channel surface sits above its bed even high in the
  hills — a river bed bottoms out at sea level and climbs, so the older
  "terrain height < 0" test wrongly rejected every inland river). On land the
  water surface collapses below the terrain, so `depth ≤ 0` and the cast is
  refused with a direct `FishingError`. Sea-only tiles have no baked water
  file; they sample as flat sea level, matching the client's synthesis.
- **Wait**: uniform 4–12 s, shortened 2% per fishing level (floored at half
  the minimum). The fish — species, size, trophy — is rolled *at the bite*,
  not at resolution, but only revealed on a catch.
- **Bite** (`FishingBite` broadcast): the bobber dips. `Hook` must arrive
  within 2.5 s plus 0.5 s latency grace — judged against the server's own
  clock, so a laggy-but-in-time click is never punished and a hacked client
  can't stretch the window. Hooking *early* (before the bite) scares the fish
  off. The reaper tick allows one extra grace period before declaring an
  unanswered bite escaped, so a response racing the deadline is judged by the
  handler, not the tick.
- **End** (`FishingEnded { outcome }` broadcast): `Caught { item_def_id,
  size_cm, trophy }`, `Escaped`, or `Aborted`. A caught fish arrives through
  the normal `InventoryUpdated` (stacked), or spills as a ground item when the
  bag can't take the weight — never silently lost. Moving, attacking,
  disconnecting, dying, or `FishingStop` aborts the session.

Timers advance on a 250 ms server tick (`run_ticks` in `main.rs`) using
`tokio::time::Instant`, so the whole state machine is tested with paused time
(`server/src/game_state/tests.rs`, `fishing_tests`).

## The catch table

Anything with a `catchWeight` in `data-src/items.csv` can end up on the
hook — fish (`category: "fish"`), junk flotsam, and coin catches alike.
The catch columns:

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `rarityTier` | fish: 1 (common) … 5 (legendary); junk/coins: 0 — drives XP and skill weighting |
| `catchWeight` | relative weight in the catch table at fishing level 0 |
| `sizeDice` | rolled length in cm (e.g. `6d8`) |
| `trophyCm` | fish only — length at or above this is a trophy |

Species pick: weighted draw where each entry weighs
`catchWeight + fishing_level × rarityTier` — skill shifts the table toward
rare fish without ever emptying the commons (junk's tier 0 means skill
never makes junk *more* likely, only relatively less). Size: `sizeDice`,
plus a d20 quality roll; a natural 20 doubles the size and — for fish —
is always a trophy. Trophies are a fish concept: a nat-20 Old Boot is
just a very large boot, no celebration.

Fish are stackable, sellable (`basePrice`, ordinary merchant flow), and
edible — `category "fish"` maps to the same `Heal(dice)` use-effect as
potions. Size is deliberately **not stored on the item** so fish stay
stackable commodities; it lives only in the catch announcement.

Prices are anchored to the game's *income* economy, not just the catalog:
monster kills drop unsellable worn weapons by design, so the repeatable gold
faucets are coin piles (1–10c) and gated dungeon chests — and an NPC's
salary is 50s/day. Fish: minnow 10c, perch 25c, trout 60c, salmon 2s,
golden carp 15s (the 1-in-100 jackpot, a goblin-sword's worth). With the
flotsam rows in the table, the expected *sell* value of one catch is
~16c — a couple of coin piles, so an hour of active fishing earns roughly
half a guard's daily salary. Steady pocket money, not a money printer.
The 3s rod repays itself in ~18 average catches; final tuning is
explicitly the maintainer's call (PR0). That band is a **contract test**
(`item_defs::tests::expected_catch_value_stays_in_the_coin_pile_economy`):
if a new species or treasure row pushes the per-catch EV outside 5–25c,
the test fails and the table needs retuning.

## Flotsam (junk & coin catches)

Not everything that bites is a fish. Four flotsam rows share the catch
table (~15% of level-0 draws): an **Old Boot** and a **Clump of Kelp**
(worthless bag junk — the classic fishing gag), a **Message in a Bottle**
(sells for a token 15c), and a **Sunken Coin Pouch**
(`category: "coin_catch"` — its `dice` column is a copper roll, `3d8`,
paid straight to the wallet via the same path as ground coin piles; it
never enters the bag). All are `rarityTier 0`: **no fishing XP** (the
`10·rarity²` formula grants nothing naturally), no trophy, and in the
struggle they fight like a common fish (`rarity.max(1)` clamps rounds and
tension so all-wrong play still snaps the line). An *escaped* junk catch
still pays the flat 2 XP consolation — the species is never revealed on
an escape, and a varying consolation would leak the hidden roll. Junk
keeps the bite/struggle stakes honest without inflating income — the EV
guardrail above counts flotsam in its average.

## Skill

Catches grant fishing XP: `10 × rarity²` (10 for a minnow, 250 for a golden
carp); a hooked fish that escapes consoles with 2. Fishing grants **no
character XP** — combat balance is untouched. Level effects today: shorter
waits, better rare weights. The struggle minigame will add wider response
windows.

## Client

- Click water with a rod equipped → `cast_fishing` intent
  (`managers/inputHandler.ts`; water = the baked `WaterFieldManager.surfaceAt`
  sits >0.1 m above the clicked terrain, so both ocean and rivers cast while
  dry ground still walks) → stop, face the water, send (`PlayerControl.svelte`).
  The server re-validates, so the client check only decides cast-vs-walk.
- `components/FishingBobber.svelte`: every nearby angler's bobber (broadcasts
  are radius-gated), gentle idle bob, hard dip on bite.
- `components/FishingPrompt.svelte`: status line + SPACE to hook, ESC to reel
  in. Combat-log lines narrate cast/bite/outcome.
- State in `stores/fishingStore.ts`; server messages handled in
  `network/messageHandlers.ts`.

## Agent parity

Agents speak the same protocol: `FishingBite` carries everything needed to
respond, and the windows (2.5 s + grace) are sized for an agent-client's
network round trip as much as for human reflexes — no mechanic requiring
reactions only software can deliver, none too fast for software either.

The agent-client implements this as a reflex layer (`src/state.rs`): it
auto-hooks its own bites and answers each struggle round with the correct
action — mechanically, like its A* movement layer, while the LLM makes the
decisions via two actions: `{"type": "fish", "x": …, "z": …}` (coordinates
optional — omitted means "just ahead") and `{"type": "stop_fishing"}`.
Outcomes come back to the model as `[Fishing]` events; in-flight messages
are classified as noise so they cost no LLM calls. Instant reflex answers
confer no advantage: correctness is binary and the tension math ignores
response speed inside the window.

## The struggle

Hooking is only the start: the fish fights for `2 + rarity` rounds (a minnow
3, a golden carp 7). Each round the server announces the fish's state in a
`FishingStruggleRound` broadcast — **Pulling** (answer: give line) or
**Tiring** (answer: reel) — with a response window of
`3000 − 150·(rarity−1) + 60·skill` ms, clamped to [1800, 3000], plus the
usual latency grace. A **tension meter** starts at 0: correct answers relax
it by 10, wrong or missed answers add `30 + 5·rarity`, and at 100 the line
snaps (`Escaped`, consolation XP). Survive every round and the fish lands.

The announced state is public information by design: the challenge is
answering correctly in time, not guessing hidden state — which is exactly
what keeps humans (reading the prompt) and agent-clients (auto-answering
after a human-like delay) on equal footing. Each answer is confirmed with a
`FishingRoundResult` carrying the new tension, and trophy catches are
celebrated to everyone in delivery radius via the `FishingEnded` broadcast
they already receive.

## Deliberate limits

- No bait, no rod tiers, no designated fishing spots (any water — ocean or
  river — works).
- Cast/idle animations reuse existing clips; dedicated Mixamo clips and
  splash/reel SFX come with the polish pass.
